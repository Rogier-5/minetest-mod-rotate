This wrench (not to be confused with the technic wrench) makes the rotating
of nodes much more intuitive.

It has two major modes of operation:
1) Rotation mode.
	In this mode, when punching a node, the node is rotated 90 degrees, the
	direction depending on the selected sub-mode. The following sub-modes are
	available:
	- clock-wise: rotate the node so that the punched side rotates clockwise
	- counter-clock-wise: rotate the node so that the punched side rotates counter-clockwise
	- left: rotate the node so that the punched side moves to the left
	- right: rotate the node so that the punched side moves to the right
	- up: rotate the node so that the punched side moves upwards
	- down: rotate the node so that the punched side moves downwards

	The desired sub-mode is selected by right-clicking. With the mode, the picture
	of the wrench changes to indicate which mode is selected.

	As multiple rotations are most likely needed to correctly position a node,
	subsequent rotations of the same node do not add additional wear to the wrench.
	Punching 2 nodes alternatingly *does* add wear on every punch.

2) Positioning mode.
	In this mode, when punching a node, the node is rotated to a preconfigured
	orientation. I.e. whatever the initial orientation of nodes, after punching
	they will have the same orientation.

	This mode is selected by crafting a wrench into positioning mode. It can then
	be crafted back into rotation mode.

	The desired position is configured by right-clicking any node, which configures
	the wrench to the current orientation of the clicked-node. For most regular nodes,
	which don't have an orientation, this resets to the default orientation.

	The selected position is indicated graphically in the top-right of the image.
	On the left, 6 positions indicate the rotation axis direction: pointing up, north,
	south, east, west, down.
	On the right, 4 positions indicate the rotation round that axis: 0, 90, 180, 270
	degrees respectively.

The wrench comes in four versions: wooden (optional), steel, copper, gold. The wooden
wrench is exceptionally cheap, and wears very fast (approx. 10 uses). The steel wrench
has approx 450 uses, the copper wrench approx. 1.5 times as many, the golden wrench
approx 2 times as many. The number of uses of the steel wrench can be configured,
automatically changing those of the copper and gold wrenches as well (but note that
wrenches are expensive: they require 4 ingots).

Every wrench has two crafting recipies (in case the main one conflicts with another mod).
requiring 4 ingots (or 4 sticks), and one extra planks for the alternate recipe

The operation of the wrench has been optimized: all required information is precomputed
at startup. Actual operation of a wrench basically requires just a few table lookups.
